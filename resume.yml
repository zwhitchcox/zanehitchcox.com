summary: |
  I’ve been a full stack engineer for almost 16 years. I live and breathe code and
  love anything that runs on silicon (except Java). I’ve been an early adopter of
  most prominent web technologies, like Rust, TypeScript, WebASsembly,
  Docker, Kubernetes, ReactJS, etc., and I’m always looking to improve my skill
  set.

      * Maintainer of [Etcher](https://etcher.io/) (24.9k stars on Github), flashing millions of devices per month cross-platform for Windows, MacOS, and Linux
      * **[happy eyeballs](https://github.com/balena-io-modules/happy-eyeballs)** - standards driven method of redundant connection attempts using various protocols, eventually implemented in NodeJS core

      * **[node-ext2fs](https://github.com/balena-io-modules/node-ext2fs)** - mount ext{2,3,4} file partitions and edit file system in user space. You can create files, symlinks, hard links, directories, anything you can do on a mounted file system. This works cross platform and uses WebAssembly under the hood to talk to the [e2fsprogs](https://github.com/tytso/e2fsprogs) back end
      * **[drivelist](https://github.com/balena-io-modules/drivelist)** - Uses Native Node Module Addon written in C++, Objective-C, and TypeScript to list available block devices, determine if they are system devices, and other meta data about the drives. Works cross platform (MacOS, Linux, Windows)
      * **[node-parted](https://github.com/zwhitchcox/node-parted)** - GNU partition editor ported to TypeScript from GNU Parted using WebAssembly for cross-platform (MacOS, Linux, Windows)
      * **node-resize2fs** (soon to be open sourced) - resize ext partitions cross-platform
      * Above are more popular projects I was/am maintainer of, but I’ve contributed to many open source projects and also created many more on my own, see my [GitHub](https://github.com/zwhitchcox)
